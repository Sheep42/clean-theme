# WP CleanTheme

**TL;DR:** This is a stripped down WordPress theme created for custom theme developers to use as a starting point. This is the theme I use for my own side projects. I've tried to take a minimalist approach while including some convenience functions and libraries that I like to use. Getting started should give you enough of an overview to get going if you don't want to read all of the details.


# Getting Started

The goal of this theme is to provide an easy to understand and easy to use boilerplate theme for any custom WordPress project. 

### Requirements

**PHP**: 7.2+ Recommended
**NodeJS**: 12.16.0+
**WordPress**: 5.3.2

### Installing
Start by installing the theme into your local WordPress instance under `wp-content/themes/`

If you do not have nodejs installed, you will need to install it. You can find the latest stable version of node here: [https://nodejs.org/en/download/](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)


# Included Technologies

## Bootstrap
	
**Version: 4.3.1**

The Bootstrap scss is included in this theme for you to use and modify. By default, the theme does not import any of the bootstrap css. This is by design, it's up to you to import the stylesheets that you want or need from the bootstrap library. See the Sass & CSS section for more details.

The minified bootstrap JS is also included in this theme. The bootstrap JS is loaded by default, to learn more about how vendor JS is imported into the theme, take a look at the JS section.

## Slick Slider

**Version: 1.8.1**

The minified slick slider JS is included in this theme. Slick is loaded by default and ready to use. To learn more about how vendor JS is imported into the theme, take a look at the JS section.
